# Millennium-Cohort-Study-Data-Restructuring 

This script shows how we restructured and merged datasets from wave 1 to 6 of the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) to a longitudinally merged dataset structured as one row per cohort member in R, i.e. wide format. Note that this is carried out on a selected list of variables and datasets specific to our research, so users wanting to replicate this should pay particular attention to the first two sections (1. Reading in Datasets and 2. Creating Subsets) and how this effects subsequent steps. Users should familirise themselves with the MCS datasets by reading the survey documentaion provided by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies [here](https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/millennium-cohort-study) before using the script.
